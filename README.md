# Counter
This project consists ,as stated by the title, of a ***Counter***, a counter that can be used by any user to increase and/or decrease the value that is shown on the display.

In fact, the ***Counter*** has a display on which the value is shown and , underneath, two buttons corresponding to - and + that have the purpose of increasing or decreasing the value itself.

With Javascript, the  ***Counter*** was completely realized, starting from the structure of the counter to the realization of the display and the buttons, implemented later to allow the action of increasing and decreasing the value(not below zero).

HTML5,was used for the realization of the titles, and CSS3 for the design of both the titles and the  ***Counter***,

The user will simply click on the desired button to increase or decrease the value at will.

The latter ,however, will be reset to zero when the page is refreshed or reopened.

Round lines have been used to give a *soft* look to both the Counter and the title ,accompanied by shades of blue with some effects of shaded white shadows, maintaining the homogeneity of colors throughout the design.

All this was designed to make the  ***Counter*** easy and intuitive to use by any user and at the same time pleasing to the eye.
